            <h2>Camping on the Playa</h2>
            <p>For the most immersive experience, camping directly on the Alvord Desert playa is permitted and free. Wake up to sunrise over the desert floor and fall asleep under a canopy of stars. This is our top recommendation for adventurous guests.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>No facilities—bring everything you need</li>
                <li>Leave no trace principles apply</li>
                <li>Best for self-sufficient campers with proper gear</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Alvord Hot Springs</h2>
            <p>Located right at the edge of the playa, Alvord Hot Springs offers a few rustic cabins and camping spots with access to natural hot spring pools. Book well in advance—it's a popular spot.</p>
            
            <h2>Fields Station</h2>
            <p>The tiny town of Fields (population: ~6) has a small store, cafe famous for its milkshakes, and basic lodging. It's the closest thing to civilization near the desert.</p>
            
            <h2>Burns, Oregon</h2>
            <p>For those preferring traditional lodging, the town of Burns is about 1.5 hours from the playa and offers several motels and hotels:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Silver Spur Motel</strong> — Clean, affordable, locally owned</li>
                <li><strong>Best Western Plus</strong> — Reliable chain option with standard amenities</li>
                <li><strong>Historic Central Hotel</strong> — Charming historic property in downtown Burns</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Frenchglen</h2>
            <p>About an hour from the playa, the historic Frenchglen Hotel is a charming option. This small, rustic hotel offers a glimpse into Oregon's ranching heritage. Reservations are essential.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
            <p>If you're up for it, we'd love for you to camp with us on the playa the night before and after the wedding. There's nothing quite like sharing a desert sunset and stargazing with the people we love most.</p>
